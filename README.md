# talk-to-me
PoC of talking to yourself

scrape whatsapp (use whisper to get audio data), finetune qlora zephyr with that data, clone your voice with XTTS, make a telegram/whatsapp bot. 

neet to figure out how to train a model on a conversation (you vs the other) and make the model learn how do YOU respond to different OTHERS. 

maybe we could have different versions of yourself by training only on chats where you've been mean, compassionate, aggresive, and so on. We could have an LLM label the conversations or chunks of conversations or messages of conversations, and use that to create a curated dataset; or maybe we could just prompt-engineer; or maybe do both. Different models (mean, aggresive, compassionate) would also need different voices, maybe we could ask the user to upload an audiofile being mean, vs bein compassionate, and so on?






Cool to add: AN AVATAR TO TALK TO YOURSELF THROUGH VIDEOCONFERENCE! or a metaverse character! or an hologram!
