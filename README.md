# see-yourself

PoC of seeing yourself from the outside, by talking to a clone of yourself. 

scrape whatsapp (use whisper to get audio data), finetune qlora zephyr with that data, clone your voice with XTTS, make a telegram/whatsapp bot. 

neet to figure out how to train a model on a conversation (you vs the other) and make the model learn how do YOU respond to different OTHERS. 

maybe we could have different versions of yourself by training only on chats where you've been mean, compassionate, aggresive, and so on. We could have an LLM label the conversations or chunks of conversations or messages of conversations, and use that to create a curated dataset; or maybe we could just prompt-engineer; or maybe do both. Different models (mean, aggresive, compassionate, excited) would also need different voices, maybe we could ask the user to upload an audiofile being mean, vs bein compassionate, and so on?

Maybe we could ask to upload text or audios telling transformative experiences or things that were extremely important. Or maybe tell the books that marked you. 
Maybe we could ask to upload videos to clone your image. 






Cool to add: AN AVATAR TO TALK TO YOURSELF THROUGH VIDEOCONFERENCE! or a metaverse character! or an hologram!
